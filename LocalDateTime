import java.time.LocalDateTime; // import the LocalDateTime class

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    LocalDateTime myObj = LocalDateTime.now();
    System.out.println(myObj);
  }
}
//The provided Java code uses the LocalDateTime class to get the current date and time and then prints it. 
This code will output the current date and time in the format "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.nnnnnnnnn," where:

"yyyy" represents the year (four digits).
"MM" represents the month (01-12).
"dd" represents the day of the month (01-31).
"T" is a separator between the date and time.
"HH" represents the hour (00-23).
"mm" represents the minute (00-59).
"ss" represents the second (00-59).
"nnnnnnnnn" represents nanoseconds (000000000-999999999).
When you run this code, it will display the current local date and time. Here's an example of what the output might look like:

2023-05-12T14:30:45.123456789
This output represents May 12, 2023, at 2:30:45 PM, 123 milliseconds, 456 microseconds, and 789 nanoseconds. The actual date and time values will change each time you run the program, reflecting the current date and time.
